## Hello world! 👋

### Glad to see you here! 🤩

### ⚡ My Coding Mantra:
*"If it works in the first build, I probably didn't challenge myself enough"*  
*(Spoiler: It never works in the first build)* 🛠️💥

### 🧑🚀 My Tech Journey
A 9-year Android veteran who:
- Speaks fluent Kotlin before morning coffee ☕
- Turns Jetpack Compose into digital playgrounds 🎨
- Believes good architecture is like South Indian filter coffee - strong foundation with perfect layers ☕
- Gets weirdly excited about reducing APK size 🎉

### 🔥 Current Obsessions
```kotlin
val passions = listOf(
    "Making Multiplatform my middle name", 
    "Chasing that 60fps like it's the last vada pav",
    "Converting 'it works' to 'it works beautifully'",
    "Battling legacy code like a Bengaluru traffic warrior"
)
```
